    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.light2015.org/Home/About.html">International Year of Light 2015</a> is a UNESCO initiative focusing on the applications and benefits of light science.  Thanh Nga participated in the Opening Ceremony in January in Paris to give a presentation about VAC&rsquo;s work.  She wrote a follow-up <a href="http://light2015blog.org/2015/03/30/changing-lives-with-light-helping-children-with-disfiguring-birthmarks">article for the International Year of Light 2015 blog</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Vietnam VAC has been improving the state of dermatopathology in Ho Chi Minh City, which started with only one doctor, an old microscope, and was using candle wax for embedding.  We provided training for physicians in the United States, obtained donated equipment, and held courses in dermatology, laser medicine and pathology. Over the past 6 years, the center has treated over 2,000 children on a free, safe, and effective basis.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends of Vietnam VAC,</p>

<p>With great excitement, we would like to share with you our first Vietnam VAC newsletter! We had a wonderful and successful trip to Vietnam last month (Feb 9-14, 2014), filled with patient care, teaching, camaraderie and wonderful memories, including the images of 30 parents and children whom Vietnam VAC has helped and who personally came to thank us during our 5th anniversary celebration. We gained new members (from all over the US and also Korea) who joined in our effort to help the children: Drs. Denise Metry &amp; Howard Pride (pediatric dermatologists), Dr. Bruce Smoller (dermatopathologist), Dr. Anton Hasso (interventional radiologist), and Dr. Ju Hee Lee (dermatologist/laser expert). Two wonderful residents from Harvard (Dr. Brooke Eastham) as well as Canada (Dr. Faisal Alsubhi) also attended the conference and clinics. We are fortunate to have a new corporate sponsor, Lutronic Corporation, who made a generous donation of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser for pigmented lesions, which is much needed to keep up with the volume of patients that we see. To keep you abreast of our activities at the Vietnam Vascular Anomalies Center, please read <a href='http://vietnamvac.isamonkey.org/documents/Letter-from-Vietnam-2014.pdf'>a summary of the Vietnam trip</a>. As you can see from the summary, we did accomplish a lot in the short time we were there and also managed to have tons of fun. Our deepest thanks to you for your generous support and for caring for the children of Vietnam!</p>

<p>We also would like to highlight that our activities at Vietnam VAC were filmed and shown on national Vietnamese TV on Feb 28. Below are the two YOUTUBE web links of the TV clip. Sorry, it is all in Vietnamese, but hopefully you can see in the images what we did in Vietnam.</p>

We would love your presence and support.

<p>&ldquo;We love the children. And we have learned so much in the past five years. The ability to learn from each other, to exchange ideas, to set up a clinic from scratch and see it blooming, to be able to help jump start research and educational programs in dermatology in Vietnam, to give back, to help children who would go otherwise go through life with disfiguring birthmarks is tremendously rewarding&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We would like to share with you a great news from Vietnam Vascular Anomalies Center (VAC).   The Cancer Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City will no longer perform radioactive phosphorus 32P treatment for hemangiomas in children!  It is a great achievement for Vietnam VAC, especially for VAC&rsquo;s Medical Director Dr. Hoang Minh and the medical team in Vietnam, who have worked tirelessly to make this happen and have aired our interview when we were in Saigon as well as a documentary about hemangiomas, its current treatments including laser therapy, and the damages done to children from radioactive phosphorus!  The Vietnam television crew was also very helpful, airing the documentary at least 4-5 times to help raise awareness.  The doctors and the Cancer Hospital have admitted that the treatment is harmful and are interested in collaborating with our doctors at VAC to learn about new therapies for hemangiomas and port-wine-stains.</p>

<p>This is fantastic news and one of the primary goals of Vietnam VAC!  We are so grateful for all of your support and hard work to make this happen!  It is a beginning step to get modern treatment to the children with vascular birthmarks in Vietnam.</p>
