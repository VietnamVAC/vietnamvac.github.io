    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends of Vietnam VAC,</p>

<p>With great excitement, we would like to share with you our first Vietnam VAC newsletter! We had a wonderful and successful trip to Vietnam last month (Feb 9-14, 2014), filled with patient care, teaching, camaraderie and wonderful memories, including the images of 30 parents and children whom Vietnam VAC has helped and who personally came to thank us during our 5th anniversary celebration. We gained new members (from all over the US and also Korea) who joined in our effort to help the children: Drs. Denise Metry &amp; Howard Pride (pediatric dermatologists), Dr. Bruce Smoller (dermatopathologist), Dr. Anton Hasso (interventional radiologist), and Dr. Ju Hee Lee (dermatologist/laser expert). Two wonderful residents from Harvard (Dr. Brooke Eastham) as well as Canada (Dr. Faisal Alsubhi) also attended the conference and clinics. We are fortunate to have a new corporate sponsor, Lutronic Corporation, who made a generous donation of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser for pigmented lesions, which is much needed to keep up with the volume of patients that we see. To keep you abreast of our activities at the Vietnam Vascular Anomalies Center, please read <a href='http://vietnamvac.isamonkey.org/documents/Letter-from-Vietnam-2014.pdf'>a summary of the Vietnam trip</a>. As you can see from the summary, we did accomplish a lot in the short time we were there and also managed to have tons of fun. Our deepest thanks to you for your generous support and for caring for the children of Vietnam!</p>

<p>We also would like to highlight that our activities at Vietnam VAC were filmed and shown on national Vietnamese TV on Feb 28. Below are the two YOUTUBE web links of the TV clip. Sorry, it is all in Vietnamese, but hopefully you can see in the images what we did in Vietnam.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanh-Nga&rsquo;s work with VietnamVAC is mentioned in an article, &ldquo;Inspiring Service: HMS Physician Honored for Service to Vietnamese Children&rdquo;, in the Harvard Medical School newsletter.</p>

<blockquote><p>[Thanh-Nga] and her team members find continued sources of inspiration and personal satisfaction in the hundreds of children that they have successfully treated over the years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We love the children. And we have learned so much in the past five years. The ability to learn from each other, to exchange ideas, to set up a clinic from scratch and see it blooming, to be able to help jump start research and educational programs in dermatology in Vietnam, to give back, to help children who would go otherwise go through life with disfiguring birthmarks is tremendously rewarding&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dermatology World, the official magazine of the American Academy of Dermatology Association, recognized Thanh-Nga for her work with Vietnam VAC.</p>

<blockquote><p>For Vietnam-born Massachusetts General Hospital dermatologist Thanh-Nga Trinh Tran, MD, PhD, bringing modern methods for treating vascular anomalies to her native country is a deep, driving motivation. Since beginning work to modernize the treatment of hemangiomas and port wine stains in children, Dr. Tran has helped improve both education and patient outcomes for many of the country’s poorest residents.</p></blockquote>
