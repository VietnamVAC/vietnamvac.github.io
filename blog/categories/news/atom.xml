    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanh-Nga's work with VietnamVAC is mentioned in an article, "Inspiring Service: HMS Physician Honored for Service to Vietnamese Children", in the Harvard Medical School newsletter.</p>


<blockquote><p>
[Thanh-Nga] and her team members find continued sources of inspiration and personal satisfaction in the hundreds of children that they have successfully treated over the years.</p>
<p>"We love the children. And we have learned so much in the past five years. The ability to learn from each other, to exchange ideas, to set up a clinic from scratch and see it blooming, to be able to help jump start research and educational programs in dermatology in Vietnam, to give back, to help children who would go otherwise go through life with disfiguring birthmarks is tremendously rewarding".
</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We would like to share with you a great news from Vietnam Vascular Anomalies Center (VAC).   The Cancer Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City will no longer perform radioactive phosphorus 32P treatment for hemangiomas in children!  It is a great achievement for Vietnam VAC, especially for VAC's Medical Director Dr. Hoang Minh and the medical team in Vietnam, who have worked tirelessly to make this happen and have aired our interview when we were in Saigon as well as a documentary about hemangiomas, its current treatments including laser therapy, and the damages done to children from radioactive phosphorus!  The Vietnam television crew was also very helpful, airing the documentary at least 4-5 times to help raise awareness.  The doctors and the Cancer Hospital have admitted that the treatment is harmful and are interested in collaborating with our doctors at VAC to learn about new therapies for hemangiomas and port-wine-stains.  This is fantastic news and one of the primary goals of Vietnam VAC!  We are so grateful for all of your support and hard work to make this happen!  It is a beginning step to get modern treatment to the children with vascular birthmarks in Vietnam.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are very excited to share with you that we are now a formal center at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Ho Chi Minh City, a premier training and educational center in Southern Vietnam.  The ribbon cutting ceremony was performed on March 6th, 2012 and the formal ceremony was done in conjunction with our third anniversary and conference at the White Palace on March 8th, 2012.  This is very exciting for us as we now have a permanent home at the University Medical Center, Branch No 3.  This will lead to better, more coordinated patient care as well as enhanced ability for teaching, training, and humanitarian collaboration.</p>


<p>We look forward to sharing with you more news about the Center in the coming months.</p>
