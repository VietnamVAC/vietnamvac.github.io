<p>A very big Thank you:</p>
<p>Vietnam Vascular Anomalies Center (VAC)<br />
Houston fundraiser benefits children in Vietnam with disfiguring birthmarks</p>
<p>On behalf of the Vietnam Vascular Anomalies Center (VAC), thank you sincerely for your generous contribution to our fundraising banquet at Kim Son Restaurant, Houston, Texas on Sunday, October 23, 2011. Your donation greatly supports our dual mission, which is to provide free medical treatment for children with disfiguring vascular birthmarks and to promote education and research on this condition in Vietnam. Together, we can improve the lives of these children and ensure the success of the first vascular anomalies center in Southeast Asia!</p>
<p>Over 400 guests, both Vietnamese and Americans, attended the fundraising event, which included education on vascular birthmarks, Vietnamese cuisine, a silent auction, and musical and dance performances. Many of you contributed generously even though you were not able to attend. Because of your generous support, the fundraiser was a great success! We have raised $43,481, after expenses! The proceeds will be directly used to provide medical treatment to children in Vietnam, including laser, medication and surgery.</p>
<p>Our fundraiser would not have been possible without the support of many generous donors. We would like to especially thank our major contributors for their wonderful support.</p>
