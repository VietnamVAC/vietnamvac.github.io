<h3>Geoff Moodie's Fundraising Triathlon</h3>
<p><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-left" src="/wp-content/gallery/people/geoff-100.jpg" alt="geoff-100" /></p>
<p>We are very fortunate to have a dear friend, Geoff Moodie, who participated in the Ironman 70.3 triathlon this year as a fund raising activity for the Vietnam VAC! The 70.3 comes from a total of a 1.2 mile swim, 56 mile bike, and 13.1 mile run. Geoff ran the Amica 70.3 Triathlon race in Providence on July 10 (http://ironmanrhodeisland.com/). His participation requires extensive time and training, so to he kindly decided to use these events to benefit our humanitarian efforts to treat children with vascular birth defects. His hard work paid off and he raised over $1000 in support of Vietnam VAC. Congratulations, Geoff!!</p>
