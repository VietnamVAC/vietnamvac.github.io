Dear Friends of Vietnam VAC,

With great excitement, we would like to share with you our first Vietnam VAC newsletter! We had a wonderful and successful trip to Vietnam last month (Feb 9-14, 2014), filled with patient care, teaching, camaraderie and wonderful memories, including the images of 30 parents and children whom Vietnam VAC has helped and who personally came to thank us during our 5th anniversary celebration. We gained new members (from all over the US and also Korea) who joined in our effort to help the children: Drs. Denise Metry &amp; Howard Pride (pediatric dermatologists), Dr. Bruce Smoller (dermatopathologist), Dr. Anton Hasso (interventional radiologist), and Dr. Ju Hee Lee (dermatologist/laser expert). Two wonderful residents from Harvard (Dr. Brooke Eastham) as well as Canada (Dr. Faisal Alsubhi) also attended the conference and clinics. We are fortunate to have a new corporate sponsor, Lutronic Corporation, who made a generous donation of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser for pigmented lesions, which is much needed to keep up with the volume of patients that we see. To keep you abreast of our activities at the Vietnam Vascular Anomalies Center, please read <a href='http://vietnamvac.isamonkey.org/documents/Letter-from-Vietnam-2014.pdf'>a summary of the Vietnam trip</a>. As you can see from the summary, we did accomplish a lot in the short time we were there and also managed to have tons of fun. Our deepest thanks to you for your generous support and for caring for the children of Vietnam!

We also would like to highlight that our activities at Vietnam VAC were filmed and shown on national Vietnamese TV on Feb 28. Below are the two YOUTUBE web links of the TV clip. Sorry, it is all in Vietnamese, but hopefully you can see in the images what we did in Vietnam.
