We are very excited to share with you that we are now a formal center at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Ho Chi Minh City, a premier training and educational center in Southern Vietnam.  The ribbon cutting ceremony was performed on March 6th, 2012 and the formal ceremony was done in conjunction with our third anniversary and conference at the White Palace on March 8th, 2012.  This is very exciting for us as we now have a permanent home at the University Medical Center, Branch No 3.  This will lead to better, more coordinated patient care as well as enhanced ability for teaching, training, and humanitarian collaboration.

We look forward to sharing with you more news about the Center in the coming months.
