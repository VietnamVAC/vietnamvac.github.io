The [International Year of Light 2015](http://www.light2015.org/Home/About.html) is a UNESCO initiative focusing on the applications and benefits of light science.  Thanh Nga participated in the Opening Ceremony in January in Paris to give a presentation about VAC's work.  She wrote a follow-up [article for the International Year of Light 2015 blog](http://light2015blog.org/2015/03/30/changing-lives-with-light-helping-children-with-disfiguring-birthmarks).

<blockquote>Vietnam VAC has been improving the state of dermatopathology in Ho Chi Minh City, which started with only one doctor, an old microscope, and was using candle wax for embedding.  We provided training for physicians in the United States, obtained donated equipment, and held courses in dermatology, laser medicine and pathology. Over the past 6 years, the center has treated over 2,000 children on a free, safe, and effective basis.
