We would like to share with you a great news from Vietnam Vascular Anomalies Center (VAC).   The Cancer Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City will no longer perform radioactive phosphorus 32P treatment for hemangiomas in children!  It is a great achievement for Vietnam VAC, especially for VAC's Medical Director Dr. Hoang Minh and the medical team in Vietnam, who have worked tirelessly to make this happen and have aired our interview when we were in Saigon as well as a documentary about hemangiomas, its current treatments including laser therapy, and the damages done to children from radioactive phosphorus!  The Vietnam television crew was also very helpful, airing the documentary at least 4-5 times to help raise awareness.  The doctors and the Cancer Hospital have admitted that the treatment is harmful and are interested in collaborating with our doctors at VAC to learn about new therapies for hemangiomas and port-wine-stains. 

This is fantastic news and one of the primary goals of Vietnam VAC!  We are so grateful for all of your support and hard work to make this happen!  It is a beginning step to get modern treatment to the children with vascular birthmarks in Vietnam.
