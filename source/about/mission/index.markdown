The mission of the Vietnam Vascular Anomalies Center (VAC) is to care for underserved children and to promote mutual learning, education, and research between Vietnamese and US physicians and other healthcare providers in the diagnosis and treatment of vascular anomalies.

Disfiguring vascular anomalies are a critical public health issue for the children of Vietnam, a country which historically has lacked the means for effective and early intervention. At the Vietnam VAC, we have provided free, safe, and effective treatment for more than 700 children and have evaluated over 2000, and we are working to help more every day!

The Vietnam VAC is seeking funds to meet its broader goals in the next 5 years. Your donation is greatly appreciated!

### Current state of treatment for vascular anomalies in Vietnam

- No specialized medical care for children with vascular birth defects in Southeast Asia
- Underdeveloped diagnostic and treatment modalities for these lesions
- Continuing use of radiation therapy that carries risk of severe scarring and cancer
- Cost of treatment is prohibitive to many families


### Objectives of the Vietnam VAC

- Continue to provide state-of-the-art, safe and free treatment for Vietnamese children with vascular birth defects
- Demonstrate a scalable and sustainable model for treating vascular anomalies in Southeast Asia


### Future Goals

- Expand free treatment to include children up to 12 years old
- Sponsor medical missions in which US physicians travel to Vietnam to help treat children with vascular anomalies
- Promote the training of Vietnamese doctors in the management of these lesions through educational exchange in the US and through site visits to Vietnam during the year
- Promote critical public health awareness of the danger of using radiation to treat infantile hemangioma
- Extend our reach to patients in other regions in Vietnam and Southeast Asia
