The mission of the Vietnam Vascular Anomalies Center (VAC) is to care for underserved children and to promote collaboration in education and research between Vietnamese and US physicians and other healthcare providers in the diagnosis and treatment of vascular anomalies, pigmented birthmarks, scars and wounds.

Disfiguring vascular anomalies and birthmarks are a major health issue for the children of Vietnam, a country that lacks the means of effective and early intervention. Over the past 5 years at Vietnam VAC, we have provided free medical evaluation as well as safe and effective treatment for over 4,800 children up to 5 years of age.  Recently, we expanded our capacity to provide free medical care for children up to 12 years of age.  We are also expanding our clinical operation to include skin wound care.  We continue to expand our scope to enhance the knowledge base and technical skills of VAC physicians in other areas that affect care for these children, including laser medicine, surgery, interventional radiology, pediatric dermatology and pathology.

The Vietnam VAC is seeking funds to meet its broader goals in the next 5 years. Your donation is greatly appreciated!

### Current state of treatment for vascular anomalies in Vietnam

- No specialized medical care for children with vascular birth defects in Southeast Asia
- Underdeveloped diagnostic and treatment modalities for these lesions
- Continuing use of radiation therapy that carries risk of severe scarring and cancer
- Cost of treatment is prohibitive to many families


### Objectives of the Vietnam VAC

- Continue to provide state-of-the-art, safe and free treatment for Vietnamese children with vascular birth defects
- Demonstrate a scalable and sustainable model for treating vascular anomalies in Southeast Asia


### Future Goals

- Expand free treatment to include children up to 12 years old
- Sponsor medical missions in which US physicians travel to Vietnam to help treat children with vascular anomalies
- Promote the training of Vietnamese doctors in the management of these lesions through educational exchange in the US and through site visits to Vietnam during the year
- Promote critical public health awareness of the danger of using radiation to treat infantile hemangioma
- Extend our reach to patients in other regions in Vietnam and Southeast Asia
