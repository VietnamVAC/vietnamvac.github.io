On behalf of the VAC, we would love for you to join us again for our 5th annual benefit concert at the beautiful Goethe Institut, Boston on December 7th from 4-8 pm (the earlier time is due to the fact that this is on a Sunday).  We promise another exciting evening of friendship, beautiful music in an intimate space, silent auctions, and wonderful food!   Please mark your calendar. More details will come as we move closer to the date. 

We are also very excited to announce the creation of a new wound care center in Ho Chi Minh City in partnership with the Serena Group Wound Management Team of [Drs. Thomas Serena and Lam Le](http://www.serenagroups.com/management/management.html).  We are working on the details but hope to inaugurate our new team and center in March of this year during our annual volunteer trip to Vietnam.   Much has been accomplished in the past years at Vietnam VAC, foremost is the expanded capacity to treat burn scars, vitiligo, as well as the abolishment of the use of radioactive phosphorus to treat children with hemangioma,  the formal establishment of an official center with the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Ho Chi Minh City, and the expansion of VAC to a new and larger space,  all made possible with the generous support of all of you!  This coming March,  we will be holding another CME course with the goal of education and exchange of expertise with our colleagues in Vietnam in areas such as dermatopathology, vascular anomalies, interventional radiology, pediatric dermatology,  and surgical treatment of complicated vascular defects.

In the mean time, please keep abreast of our work by viewing some of the [before and after photos](/events/gallery/before-after-2014) of the children we have treated. We hope they bring you as much joy as they do for us. Itâ€™s a privilege to take care of these children and in the words of Rox: "The best thing we do all year!

We are very grateful for your continued support and friendship.  And we look forward to seeing you at the benefit this coming December!
